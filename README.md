This project has been developed to imitate a real mouse in the first stage , it only uses mediapipe hand gesture detection to detect the hands , which are used to control the mouse virtually.
It uses pyautogui to interact with the gui interface of the machine.
In the second stage i will be working on gesture detction using LSTM (rnn. recurrent neural network) and bind those gesture with hotkey feature of pygautogui to make the mouse feature rich.
